In order for the speaker NPM package to build on Intel Edison yocto, add the ALSA dev library.

Get the ALSA source
ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/lib/

tar jxf alsa-lib-1.1.5.tar.bz2
cd alsa-lib-1.1.5
./configure
make install

Thanks to KurtE for that info!

I also had to manually copy the contents of /node_modules/speaker into /node_modules/audio-speaker/node_modules/speaker because the dependency under audio-speaker
wouldn't work. Manual fudge to fix later.
